## Introduction

Welcome to the "Push Swap" project. This project challenges you to implement a sorting algorithm to sort a stack of integers with specific rules and limitations.

## Project Description

In the "Push Swap" project, you are given two stacks: Stack A and Stack B. Your goal is to sort Stack A in ascending order using a limited set of operations, while minimizing the number of moves. The allowed operations include swapping the first two elements of a stack, rotating the entire stack, and pushing an element from one stack to the other.

## Usage

To use this program, follow the instructions provided by your Ã‰cole 42 instructors. You'll typically need to compile and run your program with specific input arguments, and your program should output a series of operations that, when executed, will sort the given stack.


```shell
git clone ...
make
./push_swap [list_of_integers]
```

## Rules

- Stack A initially contains a random list of integers.
- Stack B is initially empty.
- You must sort Stack A in ascending order using the allowed operations.
- The program should output a series of operations that, when executed, will sort Stack A.
- The goal is to minimize the number of operations.

## Algorithm

The "Push Swap" project challenges you to devise an efficient sorting algorithm to minimize the number of moves. Various sorting algorithms can be implemented to achieve this goal, and the choice of algorithm is part of the challenge.
